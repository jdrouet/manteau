> A fast and lightweight alternative to [Jackett](https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett/), written in Rust ü¶Ä

The goal of manteau is to get rid of the weight of [Jackett](https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett/) that takes too much of ram, comes with a UI that might not be that important.

With Manteau, you **just** start the container and it works! You can also configure the indexers you want manteau to use.

## Install

```sh
# Using docker, compatible with amd64 and arm64 for now
docker run --name manteau -d jdrouet/manteau:latest
```

You can then configure `sonarr`, `radarr` or `lidarr` to contact manteau on `http://manteau:3000` with the API path `/api/torznab` without any API key (yet).

## Run tests

```sh
cargo --workspace test
```

## Configuration

You can specify the path to your configuration file using the `CONFIG_FILE` environment variable. By default it points to `./config.toml`. You can find the default configuration file at the root of this repository.
